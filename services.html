                  <h3>Visa Waiver Countries</h3>
                  <p>Even if you are from a visa waiver country, it is important to note that you should still be a
                     genuine visitor. There is currently no visitor visa category in New Zealand that allows you to
                     enter the country with the sole purpose of looking for a job.</p>
                  <h3>All Other Countries</h3>
                  <p>You need to apply for a visitor visa before you come to New Zealand. You can apply for a maximum
                     period of 9 months (in some cases 12 months) and you must show that you are a genuine visitor
                     with
                     bona fide reasons for being in the country. Visitor visas to allow you to “look, see and decide”
                     whether New Zealand is the right place for you can be tricky, as you need to be able to show
                     your
                     ability to return to your home country and that you will not undertake work in New Zealand. We
                     can
                     assist you to ensure that the starting point on your journey to New Zealand is done correctly.

                  <h3><span style="color: #72dd78 !important;">explanation</span> conditions and requeriments</h3>
                  <p>New Zealand is a popular destination for tertiary study, and studying at New Zealand universities
                     can often lead to permanent residence in New Zealand. Most international students need to apply for
                     a student visa before they are able to live and study in New Zealand. Once a student has gained a
                     New Zealand qualification, post-study work visas provide a pathway for finding suitable employment
                     that may in time lead to permanent residence under the skilled migrant category. If you would like
                     help working through your tertiary student visa application please <strong><a
                           href="contact.html#form_cont" target="_blank">contact us</a></strong> and we would be happyto

                  <h3><span style="color: #72dd78 !important;">explanation</span> conditions and requeriments</h3>
                  <p>Work visas are often linked to a specific employer/location/job. If any of these factors were to
                     change you would have to apply for either a variation of conditions to your existing work visa OR a
                     new work visa, depending which is possible/preferable.</p>
                  <p>Note under current policy, low-skilled visa holders may only apply for 3 one year visas before
                     having a mandatory stand down period of one year outside of New Zealand.</p>
                  <p>If your work visa is expiring within the next 3 months, we recommend contacting us without delay,
                     as there can be delays in processing at Immigration New Zealand, depending on the time of year.</p>

                  <p>To get a comprehensive analysis of your particular situation, please contact us. We will provide
                     you with a written initial assessment that will act as a roadmap for your pathway to residence. You
                     will know upfront the steps required to obtain residence and the likely cost of the whole process.
                     We will also assist with obtaining the correct documentation for the process.</p>
                  <p>Once you are ready to apply, our advisers will take all the guesswork out of the process – you will
                     be regularly updated on the progress of your application and we will act as your advocate with
                     Immigration New Zealand in all aspects until such time as your application is finalised.</p>
                  <h2>Family Visa Categories</h2>
                  <p>The categories below summarize which family members may potentially qualify. Again, each case needs
                     to be investigated in depth to make sure all detailed requirements are met. The immigration policy
                     below may change from time to time.</p>
                  <p>* Partner – you are the husband, wife, de-facto or civil union partner of a New Zealand citizen or
                     resident. The key requirement here is whether you have lived together with your New Zealand citizen
                     partner in a genuine and stable relationship for at least 12 months.</p>
                  <p>* Dependent Child – you are a dependent child with a parent who is a New Zealand citizen or
                     resident.</p>
                  <p>* Parent – you have an adult child who has been a New Zealand resident for at least 3 years and you
                     meet certain income requirements for Tier 1 Category, or you meet the centre of gravity test for
                     Tier 2 Category. Note that this category is currently closed and under review by Immigration New
                     Zealand.</p>
                  <p>* Parent Retirement Category – you have an adult child who is a New Zealand resident and you can
                     nominate at least NZD $1 million to invest over four years, have NZD $500,000 of settlement funds
                     and can demonstrate an income of at least NZD $60,000 per annum.</p>

                  <h2>Business & Investment Visa Categories</h2>
                  <h3>Employee of a relocating business</h3>
                  <p>If you are a key employee of a business relocating to New Zealand, the relocation of the business
                     is supported by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise AND you are not eligible for residence under any
                     other category, then this category may be for you.</p>
                  <h3>Global Impact Residence Visa Category</h3>
                  <p>This is a relatively new visa category. You need to have held a Global Impact work visa for at
                     least 30 months and be supported by the provide for any remaining duration of the Global Impact
                     Visa Programme to qualify for residence.</p>
                  <h2>New Zealand Entrepreneur Visas</h2>
                  <p>If you are an entrepreneur and have identified a business opportunity within New Zealand, the
                     Entrepreneur Work Visa may apply to you. This is a points based application, with points being
                     awarded for prior managerial and entrepreneurial experience, capital invested etc. A successful
                     Entrepreneur Visa applicant will be granted a three-year Entrepreneur work visa with which to
                     establish and grow their business.</p>
                  <p>People who are granted an Entrepreneur Work Visa may also be able to apply for an Entrepreneur
                     Residence Visa once they have run their businesses for 2 years (or 6 months if they meet extra
                     conditions) and can demonstrate that the business is benefiting New Zealand significantly.</p>
                  <p>A number of Greenstone Global licensed immigration advisers hold post-graduate degrees in Economics
                     and have a strong background in business. We will be able to assist you in all aspects of this
                     category. Because every business plan is different, Greenstone’s advisers will work with you to
                     understand your business plan and to formulate the best strategy for your individual situation.</p>
                  <h2>Residence from Work Visas</h2>
                  <p>If you gained a work visa under work to residence instructions and you meet the required criteria,
                     you may be eligible for a residence visa under the Residence from Work category.</p>
                  <p>There are some advantages to this category. There are no English language requirements at this
                     stage and applicants are not required to obtain a certain number of ‘points’ to qualify.</p>
