               <h2>6 Top Tips For A Successful Visa Application</h2>

                  <img class="visa-image" src="images/visaapp.jpg" alt="#" />
                  <div class="full product_blog margin_top_30">
                     <p>When you are planning the trip of your dreams, visa application paperwork can often be a thorn
                        in
                        your side.</p>

                     <p>There are many factors to consider and the reality is harsh – if you’ve made a mistake on your
                        visa
                        application, it will be refused. End of story.</p>

                     <p>Here are our pro tips on avoiding the most common visa application mistakes and how to improve
                        your
                        chances of a successful outcome.</p>
                     <h2>1. Apply Early</h2>
                     <p>We always recommend applying in advance of your travel date. If you leave everything for the
                        last
                        minute, this may result in errors, incomplete information and misplaced documents</p>
                     <p>If this is your first time to apply for a visa, double-check the processing time of the embassy
                        and
                        if you don’t know the process, it’s good to have enough time to check the requirements and
                        gather
                        all the documents.</p>
                     <p>To avoid unforeseen circumstances and to ensure your visa application isn’t derailed, apply the
                        earliest you can.</p>
                     <p>We advise that you start applying at least 3 months before the start of your trip.</p>
                     <h2>2. Check what documents you need</h2>
                     <p>Every visa is different. It’s a good idea to print out the list of required documents, so you
                        have
                        a checklist you can refer to while you go to offices or banks and compile the required papers.
                     </p>
                     <p>Keep in mind, that there are documents which contain almost similar information, but are not the
                        same.</p>
                     <p>There are embassies which require that you submit additional documents. For instance, if you are
                        applying for a China tourist visa, you will need to submit documents in support of your
                        activities,
                        their corresponding dates, contact details and accommodation. You can’t just submit a list of
                        Chinese tourist attractions that you want to visit.
                     </p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
               <div class="full product_blog margin_top_30">
                  <h2>3. Have a clear purpose of travel</h2>
                  <p>Why do you want to visit that country? In almost every application form, this is one of the most
                     basic things asked. Will you be visiting friends and family or are you travelling simply for
                     sightseeing? Will you be meeting a client or visiting a conference?</p>
                  <p>You will be asked to prove your reason. So, whatever it is, it must be honest and clear.</p>
                  <p>In the end, the main thing that concerns officers in the Embassy is if you are a potential
                     immigrant, who wants to stay on a tourist visa.</p>
                  <p>Everything is really simple here – you must indicate the real purpose for which you plan to visit a
                     particular country</p>
                  <h2>4. Don’t book your travel in advance</h2>
                  <p>We always advise visa applicants not to confirm any travel arrangements, until their visa is
                     approved. Don’t forget that processing times vary, especially during busy periods.</p>
                  <h2>5. Have sufficient financial proof</h2>
                  <p>Your bank account must prove that you can financially support your visa plans. This could include a
                     bank certificate, bank statements, etc.</p>
                  <p>It’s also crucial not just to have a substantial amount in your bank account but it should also
                     have a consistent cash flow.</p>
                  <p>The good news is that some countries are straightforward in how much money you must have and in
                     most cases, this is equal to the “living expenses” that you are going to incur while you travel
                     there.</p>
                  <h2>6. Look for help if you need it</h2>
                  <p>The truth is that in some cases you’re not going to get all the information you need from the
                     embassy website, especially if your personal circumstances are a bit left-of-field.</p>
                  <p>You must never trust the information from forums because often, this advice is outdated or
                     incorrect.</p>
                  <p>The embassy requirements move at the speed of a freight train, so make sure your source of
                     information is reliable.</p>
                  <p>If you want to avoid tricky paperwork and save time from long queues in front of the embassy, you
                     should look for a reliable visa assistance partner.</p>

                  <h2>Employment Law – When is a Dismissal Justified?</h2>
                  <p>When the working relationship between an employer and an employee breaks down, the outcome can
                     often be that an employee is fired. Regardless of which side of the dismissal you’re on, this is
                     likely to be a stressful and unpleasant experience. While there is no doubt that this is a
                     difficult time for both employees and employers, it is important that dismissals are handled
                     correctly to prevent ongoing problems.</p>
                  <h2>The division of relationship property</h2>
                  <p>Relationships these days can take many different forms: marriage and civil partnerships (either for
                     the first time or later unions), co-habiting partners, casual partners, long distance
                     relationships, relationships based on companionship, relationships split between each other’s homes
                     and so on. These are just some of the types of relationship which people can experience. Further,
                     more and more commonly people are entering into relationships later in life when they have built up
                     their own assets.</p>
                  <h2>Character waivers – The importance of strong and persuasive submissions to Immigration New Zealand
                  </h2>
                  <p>When applying for a work or residency visa an applicant has to be of good character. In some
                     instances it may be necessary for an applicant to obtain a character waiver.</p>
                  <p>A character waiver is essentially when Immigration need to consider whether an action you have done
                     in the past (for many applicants this is a crime regarded as reasonably minor – such as a DUI) can
                     be excused (to enable you to obtain the type of immigration status you have applied for).</p>
